                <h3><u>Upcoming 2018 scedule</u></h3>
                <br />
                <p>The Seahawks have the fifth toughest schedule based on the win-loss record of their 2017 opponents. I mean, on the surface it sounds meaningful, but Seattle had the 25th ranked SOS last year and we know how that turned out. As always, beware that some great teams are destined to fall off for whatever reason, while some lousy teams will emerge and have respectable to terrific seasons.</p>

                <h3><u>What we know about the Seahawks schedule</u></h3>
    <br />
    
    <p>Almost guaranteed to open the season on the road. The Mariners are home on September 9th, so unless the Seahawks play a Monday night game, it’ll be a road trip to start the year, just like it was in 2017.</p>
    <br />
    <p>They’re going to London. Seattle at Oakland is going to be in London on October 14th, with a 10 AM PT kickoff, so a game that would ordinarily be 1 PM PT is actually an “early game.”</p>
    <br />
   <p>A maximum of four games will be 10 AM kickoffs. Denver is in the mountain time zone, so that has to kick off at no earlier than 1 PM PT. That leaves you with the already-confirmed Raiders game, plus the Bears, Lions, and Panthers.</p>
    
    <br />
        
            </header>
<p>The San Francisco 49ers full schedule will be released at 5 p.m. this evening, but we’ve got word on some big time matchups. The 49ers will host the Los Angeles Rams on Sunday Night Football in Week 7, and will travel to face the Seattle Seahawks on Sunday Night Football in Week 13.</p>
    <br />

            <h3><u>Reports on Earl Thomas</u></h3>           
            <br />
            <p>With the Seattle Seahawks offseason workout program starting this week and All Pro free safety Earl Thomas not in attendance, the rumors regarding a potential trade have been rampant this week. Thomas had previously stated that he intended to hold out in 2018 if he did not have a new contract prior to training camp. Well, that plan appears to have changed according to reports.</p>
            
            <br />
            
            <a href="../Progassin/"><img src="../Prog/earl%20thomas1.PNG" alt="twitter report"></a>
            <br /><br />
         <p>John Schneider may or may not have been working on a trade of Thomas for months, and Thomas may or may not be a member of the Seahawks when training camp rolls around in July, however, this is a very good sign.
             
             <br /><br />

In addition, this report comes on top of Pete Carroll stating this afternoon during a radio interview with Sportsradio 950 KJR that he expects Thomas to be a member of the team for the 2018 season and that they are counting on him.</p>
            <br />
            <a href="../index.html"><img src="../PROG/earl%20thomas%202.PNG"  alt="twitter report 2"></a>
<p>Maybe this is the team setting the table for further trade talks, or perhaps it’s something else, but for now both sides seem to be on the same page. That would put Earl in Seahawks camp and on the field for the team in 2018, and that would be great news not just for both Thomas and the Team, but fans as well.</p>
